** Building the slides

You can create the html slides yourself from within Emacs by opening the
[[./{{ cookiecutter.main_file }}.org]] file, launching =org-mode= and executing ~(require
'ox-reveal)~ (you might have to install =ox-reveal= beforehand). Then export the
org file to reveal.js (this is by default bound to the keychord =C-c C-e R R=).

If you are not a Emacs user, then just install Emacs and execute:
#+begin_src bash
emacs {{ cookiecutter.main_file }}.org -Q --batch -l export-init.el -f org-reveal-export-to-html --kill
#+end_src
